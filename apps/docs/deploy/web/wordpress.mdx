Typebot has a native [WordPress plug-in](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typebot/) that helps you embed typebots in your WordPress site.

Of course, before using it, you need to create and publish your first typebot.

The code snippet to paste is easily configurable in the Share tab of your bot after clicking on the "Wordpress" button.

## Excluded pages

The excluded pages input is a comma-separated list of pages where you don't want your typebot to appear.

Examples:

- `/app/*` will exclude all pages starting with `/app/`
- `/app` will only exclude the `/app` page
- `/app?param=1` will only exclude the `/app` page **and** with the `param` query parameter set to `1`
- `/app?param=*` will exclude the page at `/app` **and** with the `param` query parameter set to anything
- `/app/*?param=*` will exclude all pages starting with `/app/` **and** with the `param` query parameter set to anything

## Personalize user experience

You can leverage the [prefilled variables](../../editor/variables#prefilled-variables) and inject your user information directly into your typebot so that the experience is entirely customized to your user.

Here are the available variables from WordPress, make sure to create them in your typebot's variables dropdown:

<Frame style={{ maxWidth: '400px' }}>
  <img
    src="/images/embeddings/wp-variables.png"
    alt="WP predefined variables"
  />
</Frame>

The only thing you need to do to enable this is:

- Use the [Wordpress Typebot plugin](https://wordpress.com/plugins/typebot)
- Have the variables declared in your Typebot with the exact syntaxes. For the email for example, make sure your variable is spelled `WP Email`. These won't work: `wp Email`, `WP email`.

## Your typebot isn't showing?

### You have litespeed with "Localise Resources" enabled

There is an a box where there is a list of URLs it localises, one of them was ‘https://cdn.jsdelivr.net’. This URL should be removed from it since it is used to import the embed library.

## You have litespeed with cache enabled

Make sure to insert `web.js` and `typebot` in the JS Excludes textbox and JS Deferred Excludes under Tuning Settings.

### You have a cache plugin

Plugins like WP Rocket prevent Typebot to work.

For WP Rocket:

1. Go to Settings > WP Rocket > Excluded Inline Javascript:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/embeddings/wp-rocket.png" alt="WP Rocket" />
</Frame>

2. Type "typebot"
3. Save

### You have plugin that adds `defer` attribute to external scripts

You need to add an exception for Typebot in the corresponding plugin config.

### Still not working

Contact me on the application using the typebot at the bottom right corner
