title: Iframe

You can easily get your typebot iframe code by clicking on the "Iframe" button in the "Share" tab of your typebot.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/embeddings/iframe/iframe-preview.png"
    alt="Iframe preview"
  />
</Frame>

Here, you can set up its width and height. A good default is a `width` of `100%` and a `height` of `600px`.
