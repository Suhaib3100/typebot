The Google Analytics integration block allows you to track a Google Analytics event at a given moment in your flow.

When your flow contains a Google Analytics block, under the hood it:

- Initialize GA and track a "Page view" event on page load.
- Track the event if any when the block is executed.

## Track conversions with Google Ads

To track conversions for your Google Ad, you can add a Google Analytics block whenever you'd like to trigger the conversion event with the following properties:

- Event action: conversion
- Send to: \<YOUR_AW_ID\>
- Value (optional): a number to quantify the conversion

## Troubleshooting

To help you debug how your Google Analytics behaves, I suggest you add the [Google Analytics Debugger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna) extension to your browser.
