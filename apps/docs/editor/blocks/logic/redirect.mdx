The Redirect logic block allows you to redirect your user to a given URL either on the current tab or in a new tab.

<Warning>
  Safari and iOS devices will block a redirect in a new tab by default so a
  popup will be displayed to the user. Make sure to test your redirect logic
  block on these devices.
</Warning>
