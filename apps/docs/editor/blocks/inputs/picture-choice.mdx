The Picture choice input block allows you to offer your user predefined choices illustrated with a picture, either single choice options or multiple choices

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/blocks/inputs/picture-choice.png"
    alt="Picture choice overview"
  />
</Frame>

For advanced configuration, check out the [Buttons block](./buttons) documentation. It works the same way.
